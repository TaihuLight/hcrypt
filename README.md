### About

The libhcrypt aims to provide multiple homomorhpic encryption schemes with a
generailized interface. It hopes to implement encryption schemes including:

 * rsa		- unpadded rsa, ciphertext mul
 * elgamal	- elgamal encryption, ciphertext mul
 * ec		- elliptic curve elgamal, ciphertext add
 * paillier	- paillier cryptosystem, ciphertext add
 * bgn		- boneh-Goh-Nissim, many ciphertext add, one mul
 * nullint	- null algor do no encrypt/decrypt, thus support any add and mul
 * nullstr
